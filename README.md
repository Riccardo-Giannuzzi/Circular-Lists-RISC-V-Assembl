# Circular Linked List Implementation in RISC-V

This project features a circular linked list implemented in RISC-V assembly language. It includes essential operations such as adding and removing nodes, printing the list, and performing shifts (both left and right). Additionally, the implementation supports reversing the list and sorting its elements.

The goal was to demonstrate efficient memory management and data manipulation in a low-level programming environment while adhering to the principles of linked list structures.
